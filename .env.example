# Docker Image Configuration
# These variables control which Docker image is used in docker-compose.yml
# For forks, update IMAGE_OWNER to your GitHub username

# GitHub Container Registry image owner (defaults to mccoysc)
IMAGE_OWNER=mccoysc

# Repository name (defaults to gramine-web3-wallet-docker)
IMAGE_REPO=gramine-web3-wallet-docker

# Image tag (defaults to latest)
IMAGE_TAG=latest

# Example for a fork:
# IMAGE_OWNER=yourname
# IMAGE_REPO=gramine-web3-wallet-docker
# IMAGE_TAG=latest

# Note: You can also use the helper script scripts/compose-up.sh
# which automatically detects the owner from your git remote
